Predictive Modeling of Customer Bookings
This project aims to predict customer booking completions using machine learning models. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter notebook, leveraging various Python libraries for data manipulation, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

Project Structure
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial data exploration to understand the dataset and its statistical properties.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, conversion, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling.
Model Training and Evaluation: Implementation of machine learning models, evaluation of their performance, and identification of key contributing features.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of various features related to customer bookings. Here are some key columns:

num_passengers: Number of passengers traveling.
sales_channel: Channel through which the booking was made.
trip_type: Type of trip (e.g., Round Trip, One Way).
purchase_lead: Number of days between the booking date and travel date.
length_of_stay: Number of days spent at the destination.
flight_hour: Hour of flight departure.
flight_day: Day of the week of flight departure.
route: Origin and destination route of the flight.
booking_origin: Country where the booking was made.
wants_extra_baggage: Indicates if the customer wanted extra baggage.
wants_preferred_seat: Indicates if the customer wanted a preferred seat.
wants_in_flight_meals: Indicates if the customer wanted in-flight meals.
flight_duration: Total duration of the flight in hours.
booking_complete: Flag indicating whether the booking was completed.
Requirements
To run the notebook, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

bash
Copy code
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Exploratory Data Analysis
The initial phase of the project involves loading the dataset and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data. We examine the first few rows of the dataset using df.head() and analyze data types and missing values using df.info(). The summary statistics of numerical columns are generated using df.describe().

We also visualize key aspects of the data:

Booking Completion Distribution: A count plot to visualize the distribution of completed and incomplete bookings.
Purchase Lead Time vs Booking Completion: A boxplot to explore the relationship between purchase lead time and booking completion.
Correlation Matrix: A heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical variables.
Data Preprocessing
Several preprocessing steps are performed to prepare the data for modeling:

Label Encoding: Categorical features such as sales_channel, trip_type, booking_origin, and route are encoded using LabelEncoder.
Feature Scaling: Numeric features like purchase_lead, length_of_stay, flight_hour, and flight_duration are scaled using StandardScaler.
Data Splitting: The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Model Training and Evaluation
We train a logistic regression model to predict booking completion. The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix that shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
Challenges
The model may face convergence issues during training, which can be addressed by increasing the number of iterations (max_iter) or using alternative solvers.
Feature Importance
The top contributing features to booking completion are visualized using a bar plot, helping us understand the most influential factors in customer bookings.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a predictive model for customer bookings, starting from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The insights derived from this analysis can guide further improvements in customer engagement and booking strategies.
